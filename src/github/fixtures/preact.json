  "body": "This is a maintenance release, upgrading should be free, please do report it in case you encounter any issues.\r\n\r\n## render-queue sorting\r\n\r\nPreact batches all rendering work and executes from the top of the Virtual DOM tree to the bottom. However, if new rendering tasks were added during an existing render, they were processed without regard for their depth in the tree.\r\n\r\nThanks to a clever fix from @jviide, Preact's render queue is now immutable. Any new tasks added during rendering are placed into a second batch.\r\n\r\n## material-ui integration\r\n\r\nA peculiar issue users were seeing with material-ui related to a ref never getting populated, we went very deep into the codebase and found out that our forwardRef was a bit too eager, at creation it would already start forwarding. We moved this to a later point, now just before the vnode will get diffed the ref will be forwarded.\r\n\r\n## Fixes:\r\n- Fix mui Popover integration (#2403, thanks @JoviDeCroock)\r\n- Fix defaultValue with re-render (#2392, thanks @aralroca)\r\n- Sort new renderqueue items (#2396, thanks @jviide)\r\n\r\n## Maintenance:\r\n- Fix stopPropagation override for IE11 (#2390, thanks @JoviDeCroock)\r\n- Use createEvent since InputEvent and new Event won't work in IE11 (#2400, thanks @JoviDeCroock)\r\n- Fix useErrorBoundary hook callback type (#2397, thanks @Sasha-Sorokin)\r\n- Update cloneElement typings (#2388, thanks @ddayguerrero)"
