  "body": "_**tl;dr:** Another bug-fix only release. It's safe to upgrade and we encourage everybody to do so_ :+1: \r\n\r\nIt's sunny today and I haven't been outside yet, so I'll make it quick: Those pesky ref TypeScript errors when used with a CSS-in-JS library should be no more! So if you're using `styled-components`, `emotion`, `goober` or any other CSS-in-JS library, this update is for you! :100: \r\n\r\n@robertknight found that `false` values where not special cased for `aria-*` attributes as they have a different way of treating boolean values compared to the DOM. Many boolean-like attributes like `aria-checked` have three states:\r\n\r\n- `true` element is checked\r\n- `false` element is unchecked, but it's possible to check it\r\n- `undefined` (default) element can't be checked\r\n\r\nAs usual thank you so much for everyone who helped make Preact better by contributing code or reporting issues! You all rock :+1: \r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n- Add support for `false` value in aria-attributes (#2347, thanks @marvinhagemeister)\r\n- Remove array provided to callback in `React.Children.map` and `.forEach` (#2326, thanks @mhmdanas)\r\n- Fix `React.Children.map/forEach` missing index (#2322, thanks @JoviDeCroock)\r\n\r\n## Typings\r\n\r\n- Match `useErrorBoundary` type with `componentDidCatch` (#2332, thanks @intrnl)\r\n- Fix incompatible `ref` typing with ReactElement (& popular react libraries) (#2099, thanks @xiel)\r\n- Make `useErrorBoundary`'s callback param optional (#2320, thanks @intrnl)\r\n\r\n## Maintenance\r\n\r\n- Fix failing `useImperativeHandle` tests (#2346, thanks @marvinhagemeister)\r\n- Create `ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md` (#2342, thanks @JoviDeCroock)\r\n- Node \"exports\" adjustments (#2327, thanks @guybedford)\r\n- Add `package.json` to `package.exports` (#2319, thanks @MylesBorins)"
