  "body": "This release fixes two bugs, an algorithmic problem with unsubscribing components and a memory leak with `connect`.  It also has optimizations for production bundle size, and adds a couple small improvements to developer readability while debugging.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n### Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n`connect` in v7 is implemented using hooks, and the hooks usage captures numerous values from the surrounding scope.  We received a PR informing us that the way we were capturing these values would likely result in a copy of the first version of its props being kept alive indefinitely.\r\n\r\nThis memory leak has been fixed by extracting a custom hook that receives all the necessary values as arguments, so that they're not captured via closure.\r\n\r\nWe also received a PR letting us know that the unsubscribe logic had a quadratic algorithm in it, as removing a subscriber would use an `indexOf(listener)` check to remove that callback.  If there were a large number of subscribers, that line's runtime would increase rapidly, causing slowdowns.\r\n\r\nThis algorithm has been replaced with tracking subscribers via a linked list, which drastically improves the runtime of this section of the code even with large numbers of subscribers.\r\n\r\nThanks to @larrylin28 and @wurstbonbon for finding these bugs and submitting PRs to fix them!\r\n\r\n### Bundle Size Improvements\r\n\r\nWe've made a number of small tweaks to the codebase to improve the ability of bundlers to shake and minimize the final included size in a bundle.  The net result is that [`react-redux@7.2.0` is smaller than 7.1.3](https://bundlephobia.com/result?p=react-redux@7.2.0), dropping 1.3K min and 0.6K min+gzip.  (In fact, it's even smaller than the pre-hooks 7.0.0 when gzipped!)\r\n\r\nThanks to @Andarist for doing most of the work on this!\r\n\r\n### Debugging Improvements\r\n\r\nThe `ReactReduxContext` instance now has a `displayName` set, so it should show up in the React DevTools as `ReactRedux.Provider`.\r\n\r\nAlso, when an error is caught in `useSelector` and re-thrown, we now append the original stack trace.\r\n\r\nThanks to @pieplu and @r3dm1ke for these!\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\n- Fix memory leak issue with `UseEffect` (@larrylin28 - #1506)\r\n- Optimize createListenerCollection (@wurstbonbon - #1523) \r\n- Rethrowing original errors thrown in selector functions (@Andarist - #1474)\r\n- Remove invariant in favor of doing NODE_ENV checks directly (@Andarist - #1472)\r\n- Wrap .propTypes and .displayName assignments with __DEV__ check (@Andarist - #1471)\r\n- Add pure annotations to help with DCE  (@timdorr - 5e0c50d)\r\n- Inline this function.  (@timdorr - 58ae5ed)\r\n- Add a displayName on ReactReduxContext (@pieplu - #1462)\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/reduxjs/react-redux/compare/v7.1.3...v7.2.0"
